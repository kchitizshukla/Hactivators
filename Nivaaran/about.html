        <p>    Welcome to निवारण<br>

            निवारण is an initiative by the Government of India under the Ministry Of Home Affairs wherein all the information about the past, present and future rescue operations will be shared for the victims.
            Some of the rescue operations conducted in the past are as follows:<br>

          
1. Operation Flood (1970-1996): Also known as the White Revolution, this was the world's largest dairy development program. It aimed to increase milk production and provide a reliable source of income to Indian farmers. Operation Flood helped transform India from a milk-deficient country to one of the world's largest milk producers.<br>

2. Operation Black Tornado (2008): This operation was conducted by the National Security Guards (NSG) to combat terrorists who attacked several prominent locations in Mumbai, including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. The operation was a response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks.<br>

3. Operation Rahat (2013): Operation Rahat was a massive rescue and relief operation conducted by the Indian Armed Forces to evacuate Indian and foreign nationals stranded in Yemen during the Yemeni Civil War. It involved the evacuation of thousands of people by air and sea.<br>

4. Operation Madad (2018): In response to the severe flooding in the Indian state of Kerala, Operation Madad was launched to provide rescue and relief to those affected by the devastating floods. The operation included the deployment of military personnel and assets for search and rescue operations and humanitarian aid distribution.<br>

5. Operation Maitri (2015): Operation Maitri was launched by the Indian government to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Nepal following a devastating earthquake that struck the country in April 2015. India played a significant role in the international relief efforts.<br>

6. Operation Sankat Mochan (2016): This was another evacuation operation conducted by the Indian Air Force to evacuate Indian nationals from South Sudan during a period of conflict and instability in the region.<br>

7. Operation Vijay (1999): Operation Vijay was conducted by the Indian Army to recapture territory in the Kargil region of Jammu and Kashmir that had been infiltrated by Pakistani soldiers and militants. The conflict came to be known as the Kargil War.<br>

These are just a few examples of the numerous rescue and relief operations that have taken place in India over the years. India's armed forces, disaster management agencies, and various organizations have consistently worked to respond to natural disasters, conflicts, and humanitarian crises to provide assistance to those in need.<br>

          <h1>Our Agencies</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle-C">Following are the agencies that work hard day and night for the safety of our fellow countrymen
            and rescue the victims from various natural and man made calamities.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="cardv">
          <h4>Indian Army</h4>
          <p>The Indian Army has a long history of participating in rescue operations, both within India and in other countries. 
            The primary role of the Indian Army is to defend the nation's borders and maintain internal 
            security. However, they are also frequently called upon to assist in various rescue and relief operations during natural disasters 
            and humanitarian crises.</p>
          <p>The Indian Army's involvement in rescue operations is part of its commitment to assisting civilians and ensuring the safety and 
            well-being of the population, both within India and abroad when called upon. Their expertise, resources, 
            and dedication make them a valuable asset in times of crisis.</p>
          <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Army played a significant role in setting up quarantine facilities, 
            transporting medical supplies, and assisting in the distribution of vaccines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cardv">
          <h4>Air Force</h4>
          <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) plays a critical role in conducting rescue and relief operations in India and occasionally abroad. 
            With its fleet of aircraft, helicopters, and skilled personnel, the IAF can quickly respond to a 
            wide range of emergencies and provide vital support</p>
          <p>The Indian Air Force's ability to rapidly deploy assets, conduct precision operations, and provide critical support in challenging conditions makes it an 
            invaluable resource during times of crisis. Their commitment to humanitarian assistance and disaster 
            relief is a testament to their dedication to the safety and well-being of the Indian population and 
            their neighbors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cardv">
          <h4>CRPF</h4>
          <p>
            The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is one of the largest paramilitary forces in India and 
            primarily responsible for maintaining internal security and counterinsurgency operations. 
            While their primary role is not focused on conducting rescue operations, they can be called upon to 
            assist in various rescue and relief efforts during emergencies and disasters. </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that while the CRPF may participate in these types of operations, 
            their primary role is maintaining internal security and countering insurgencies. Other agencies, 
            such as the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and state police 
            forces, are usually the first responders in major disaster situations. The coordination among these 
            agencies is critical to effectively respond to and manage rescue and relief operations during 
            emergencies and disasters in India.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cardv">
            <h4>NSG</h4>
            <p>The National Security Guard (NSG) is an elite counter-terrorism and special operations force in India. 
                While their primary mission is to handle counter-terrorism and anti-hijacking operations, they are 
                occasionally involved in rescue and relief operations during specific situations, especially when a 
                specialized force is required</p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that the NSG's involvement in rescue operations is usually limited 
                to situations that require their specialized skills and training. For most general rescue and relief 
                efforts during natural disasters or other emergencies, agencies like the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), 
                state police, and the armed forces typically take the lead. The NSG's primary focus remains on counter-terrorism and 
                high-threat security operations.
